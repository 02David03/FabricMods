# Todo
- Update NonCorrelatedExtras & UserDefinedAdditions to 1.16-rc1
- Move Expanded Storage to Screen Handler v1 API
- Make it so chainmail-config requires a config supplier instead of using class.newInstance ( non-issue )
- Fix chainmail-config config merging bug ( non-issue )
# Ideas
- Recipe Ingredient command which list all the primitive ingredients needed for a recipe 
  - perhaps displayed as a tree in chat or make it as a REI plugin
