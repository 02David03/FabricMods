- Added netherite chest advancement ( was missing )
- Added old obsidian to old netherite chest recipe ( was missing ) Thanks Shnupbups
- Made netherite recipes require a smithing table.
- Changed wooden chest tag to one that other mods use
- Added Barrels
- Recipes are now grouped, for example both iron chest recipes will appear as one entry in the recipe book
- Old Chest textures are now stored as mini-atlases ( can still be scaled to make 32x 64x ect textures)

Note: The barrel textures are temporary and require an axe to break, once updated they will require a pickaxe.
